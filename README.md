# TypeScript Standard Library

[![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/monumentjs/core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/monumentjs/core)

**Standard library** provides **high quality** and **reusable** codebase written in TypeScript. 
It designed for development of **large applications** when **scalability** and **consistency** 
are very important.


## Motivation

It would be nice to have a consistent standard library with tons of solutions under one hood, to have possibility to easily pick necessary ones and combine them with less amount of "clue"?
