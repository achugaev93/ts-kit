# TypeScript Standard Library

This project is aimed to provide a high quality standard library of common and specific functionality for 
server and client applications.


## Goals

- Bring the most frequently used functionality (FUF) into TypeScript class library
- Cover FUF with tests
- Create solutions base for isomorphic applications
- Provide HQ level of abstraction that allow to scale application


## Roadmap

This library should cover many aspects of application architecture. Some of them are:

- Base types
  - Collections
  - Errors
  - Exceptions
- Lifecycle
  - Event management
  - State management
- Data

## Code Style

To ensure code style is the same across all library, `TSLint` is used.
