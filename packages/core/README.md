# Description

Standard library provides high quality and reusable codebase written in TypeScript. 
It designed for development of large applications when scalability and consistency 
are very important.


## The course to maximum efficiency

Standard library is aimed to provide a comprehensive codebase for developing any applications.
It's a large codebase built in accordance with the principles of OOP, SOLID and TDD.
Standard library does not force to use it entirely and does not impose restrictions on the usage of third-party solutions. 
You can easily use only functionality you really need.
